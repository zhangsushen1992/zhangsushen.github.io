Abstract:
AutoML systems have been developed focusing mostly on hyperparameter optimisation. This paper introduces an evolutionary AutoML framework, LEAF, that optimises hyperparameter, architectures and size of network. It makes use of state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms (EA) and distributed computing frameworks. Experimental results on image classification and NLP show state-of-the-art performance. LEAF demonstrates architecutre optimisation provides a significant boost over hyperparameter optimisation. Moreover, network are minimised with little drop in performance. LEAF demoncratises and improves AI, making AI practical in future applications.
