### Abstract
We propose a framework that automatically designs a CNN. A new optimisation objective function that combines error rate and the information learnt by a set of feature maps using deconvolutional networks (deconvnet) is proposed. The new objective function allows the hyperparameters of the CNN architecture to be optimised
